To make a Node.js server: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/24684/truffle-and-node-js
Example: https://github.com/gjeanmart/stackexchange/tree/master/24684-truffle-and-node-js

For production purposes, may need Geth instead of Ganache: https://hackernoon.com/ethereum-development-walkthrough-part-2-truffle-ganache-geth-and-mist-8d6320e12269

## Getting started

* Download Ganache from the website.
* `npm install`

## Running the server

* Double-click the Ganache icon to get it running.
* `truffle migrate`
* `npm start`
* Then you can start running RESTful commands to interact with the blockchain via the API!

## Testing

`truffle test`

## Ganache

Use this mnemonic:

```
candy maple cake sugar pudding cream honey rich smooth crumble sweet treat
```
