## Getting started

Download Ganache: `brew cask install ganache` or visit Ganache's website. Then start the test blockchain via Ganache by double-clicking the app icon.

Every time you change the contract, do `truffle compile`.

To start testing a contract on the test Ganache blockchain, do `truffle migrate`.

## Unit tests

`truffle test`
